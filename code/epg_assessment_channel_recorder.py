'''
A script to capture RTP network streams using VLC
taking prompts from UDP EIT table 'runningStatus' data,
or where absent reverting to EPG schedule recording.
Has to be run in virtual environment to access VLC Python
bindings and Tenacity.

main():
-- running status recording --
1. Launches recording then monitors EIT 'runningStatus'
   data for change in the '4' running category.
   Uses libdvbtee to grab Network Service ID from EIT.
2. EIT not found check, script launches EPG schedule recording if script
   fails to find EIT 15 consecutive attempts (skip to step 6)
3. EIT found so loops continually while 'active'. To turn 'active' to False,
   control_json needs changing and script exits.
4. When a change is found in current recording, the script
   stops current VLC media instance, initialises a new
   stream recording in new folder path.
5. Starts the recording again and continues monitoring
   'runningStatus' for another change. Runs continually without break

launch_epg()
-- epg schedule recording --
6. Calculates launch time and configures recording date for channels/schedules.
7. Load the day's schedule for channel received and maps all programmes to a
   'recordings' dictionary. Stores last modification time for the schedule.
8. Launches while loop which continues until busy=False, ie no more scheduled
   recordings for the day. The loop runs through these steps continually:
   i. Checks schedule for new modification, if altered then reloads schedule
      to accomodate any changes introduced to programme start/end times.
   ii. Checks if any existing recordings end times older than now in the 'handles'
      dictionary which contains details of items currently recording. If so the
      recording is stopped and the item handle is added to a recordings_deleted
      dictionary, and the item is removed from handled dictionary.
   iii. Checks through recordings dictionary items for any programmes
      not yet being recorded and whose start time is older than the time now.
      If found an MPEG TS folder is created and a VLC instance is launched and
      recording begins.
   iv. Deleted any items in recordings_deleted dictionary from recordings
      dictionary.
   v. Calculates if any items remain in handles and recordings dictionary. If no,
      then busy=False and the script exits.
   vi. Checks if stora_control.json requires recording to stop for this channel.
      If active==False, then the VLC recordings are ended immediately and the
      script exits.
9. Script completes EPG schedule recording and resets at start of code block in
   main() with rs checks for EIT re-establishment (step 1)
